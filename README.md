The Classes folder contains all classes that are used to describe the environment (MILP model) and the RL agent (A2C).

The Data folder contains all constant initial parameter values, that are obtained from the Airline Planning and Optimisation Course.

The Pickle folder contains all data that is generated in the main.py file, which is created from several long lasting simulations.

The main.py is used to create all graphs and results that are used in the final report.

The remaining .py files are used to create these results, and employ the class functions to do so.
